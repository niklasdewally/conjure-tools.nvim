# Conjure.nvim

A neovim plugin for the [Conjure]() and [Savile Row]() modelling pipeline.


This plugin is mostly taken from [essence.vim](https://github.com/Druid-of-Luhn/essence.vim),
with some `neovim` specific additions.

## Features 

* Plug and play configuration of the Conjure LSP.

* Syntax highlighting for [Essence](https://conjure.readthedocs.io/en/latest/essence.html) and [Essence'](http://savilerow.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/index.html) modelling languages.


## Installation

First, ensure [Conjure]() is installed.

Then, install with your package manager of choice.

For example, using packer:

```lua
use'niklasdewally/conjure.nvim'
```
